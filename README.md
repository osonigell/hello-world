# hello-world

Hey! I'm new to this, i followed all the primary instructions on how to make respositories and branches but i'm still confused about all of this and what ppl do on this site.
I've just started learning html yesterday (2/20/16). I'm still very basic at it. I haven't even gotten to CSS. 
I'm not sure if my assumption of what happens on this site is true so if someone could give me some insight, that would be very helpful.
Do ppl here write code and share it with everyone else, then edit eachothers code?
